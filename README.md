# Zookeeper Database System

## Description
This project is a relational database system designed for managing a zoo, developed as part of the **CSCI 3287 Database course**. The system keeps track of animals, enclosures, zookeepers, feeding schedules, medical records, and more. Built from scratch, the database includes an **ER model, schema design, and SQL queries** to manage and retrieve zoo-related data efficiently.

## Features
- **Animal Tracking:** Stores details about each animal, including species, age, and health status.
- **Enclosure Management:** Records information about enclosures, their capacity, and assigned animals.
- **Zookeeper Assignments:** Tracks which zookeepers are responsible for which animals.
- **Feeding & Medical Records:** Logs feeding schedules and medical treatments.
- **SQL Queries & Reports:** Provides various queries for data retrieval and analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Database Management System:** MySQL and PhpMyAdmin  
- **SQL:** Queries for data manipulation and retrieval  
- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):** Designed using LibreOffice Draw  
- **Three-Schema Diagram:** Designed using LibreOffice Draw  
- **Data Normalization Diagram:** Designed using LibreOffice Write and implemented into PhpMyAdmin  
- **Zoo Data Generator:** Python 3 script used to populate the database with sample zoo data  
- **Relational Algebra Queries:** Implemented using SQL and a PHP-based front-end for query execution  
- **Relational Algebra Outputs:** Results are dynamically displayed through the PHP interface  

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ZookeeperDatabase.git
   cd ZookeeperDatabase

## Usage
- Use the SQL scripts provided to create and populate the database.
- Modify or extend the schema as needed for additional features.
- Run queries to retrieve specific zoo management data.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a web interface for easy interaction.
- Add stored procedures and triggers for automated actions.
- Introduce role-based access control (RBAC) for database security.
